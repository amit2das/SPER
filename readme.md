   :black_circle: **Technique used:**

          1. ordered clustering.
          2. hierarchical clustering.
          3. regression analysis.
   
   :black_circle: **Nutshell:**
     
      > Based on the continuty of time, ordered clustering is used to introduced to obtain turning points of fluctuations.
      > detailed information during the period of before and after the earthquake is extracted to classify the composite indexes applying hierarchical clustering analysis.
      
   **As a typical emergency, natural disasters always push the panic button in the crowd, and lead to a series of negative reaction,  which known as -- Herd Effect** 
     
      > Based on Fisher ordered clustering method, we extract the turning point of stock fluctuations and build multiple stock trend indicators
      > Then we study the similarities of the global stock market using hierarchical clustering analysis method.
